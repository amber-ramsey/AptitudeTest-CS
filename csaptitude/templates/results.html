			<strong>As mentioned before, this test is for practice only, so you should not regard
			your result as of importance </strong>chiefly because <strong>the test was not taken under
				proper test conditions</strong> e.g. in a silent room with no disturbances. Your
			performance can also be distorted if you have a cold, or have not slept well. Also,
			evidence shows that <strong>international students</strong> or those from <strong>ethnic
				minorities</strong> may be disadvantaged in this type of test, due to language and
			cultural differences. If your first language is not English, your score is likely to be
			lower on such tests than native English speakers. <strong>Mature students</strong> may also sometimes be disadvantaged and you should remember that your <strong>degree
				subject</strong> may change your performance &mdash; for example <strong>scientists</strong> are likely to do
			better on mathematical tests and <strong>humanities students</strong> on verbal tests. Even your ability to
			use a mouse may influence your score! Having said all this it is still natural for you to
			want some feedback on your performance.

		<ul>
			<li><strong>22 or above.</strong> This is an <strong>above average score</strong> for graduates. See our <a href="https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/computerscience/majors.php"><strong>Computer-Related Majors</strong></a>. The next step might be to<a href="https://www.python.org/"> <strong>learn Python</strong></a><strong>. </strong></li>
			<li><strong>15 - 21.</strong> This is in the <strong>average</strong> group compared to other graduates. Whilst this test is only a rough guide, if you scored in this bracket, it suggests you may not find it easy to do well in technical computing jobs such as programming and software engineering, but may be fine in <a href="https://www.charlestonsouthern.edu/computerscience/majors.php">less technical IT roles</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>14 or below</strong>. This is <strong>below the typical score</strong> of graduates, but remember that a number of factors may have distorted your score &mdash; see above for some of these factors. You may wish to discuss your results with a careers adviser.

						If an animal is in group B, it is also in group A. <- This statement is if q then p, which is not equivallent.<br />
            			If an animal is not in group B, it is not in group A. <- This statement says if not q then not p. Since the statement above states that the animals in group A will be in group B, if the animal is not in B it can not be in A. This is the equivallent statement.<br />
            			If an animal is not in group A, it is not in group B. <- This sentence is if not p then not q, however the animal can be in group B without being in group A.<br />
            			If an animal is in group B, it is not in group A. <- This statement says if q then not p, which is not equivallent.<br />
            			If an animal is not in group B, it is in group A. <- This sentence says if not q then p, however if p is true the q must also be true, therefore it is not equivallent.<br />

						A way to simplify what is said above is, if p (the person is Sarah's friend) then q (they like to swim).<br />
						If Jill is not Sarah's friend, then she does not like to swim. <- This statement means if not p then not q, however Jill can like to swim even if she is not Sarah's friend.<br />
            			If Laura likes to swim, then she is Sarah's friend. <- This sentence says if q then p, but Sarah is not friends with every person who likes to swim.<br />
            			If Mary likes to swim, then she is not Sarah's friend. <- This sentence states if q then not p, which can not be true when the if p then q is true.<br />
            			If Amanda is Sarah's friend, then she does not like to swim. <- This statement says if p then not q. That can not be true while if p then q is true.<br />
            			If Maddie does not like to swim, then she is not Sarah's friend. <- This sentence says if not q then not p. This statement is equivallent to the question statement because since Maddie does not like to swim, she can not be Sarah's friend when all of Sarah's friends like to swim.<br />
						Which of the statements must also be true?<strong> If Maddie does not like to swim, then she is not Sarah's friend.</strong></p></td>
